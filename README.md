# jQueryExercise1

This repository contains my solution to the Ajax problem from a couple of weeks ago.  For class today you need to:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Check out the development branch.
3. Modify the code to use jQuery. (I have included it in the js folder of the project as opposed to using a CDN)
4. The modified code should use jQuery for:
  * All element references.
  * All event handler definitions.
  * The AJAX call
5. When you are finished, commit the code, push it back to your remote repository (development branch), and merge the development branch into the master branch.
